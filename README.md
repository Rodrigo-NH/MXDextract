# MXDextract
Extracts layer names, layer status (ON/OFF) and linked shapefiles in MXD files  

**Not meant to be:** Reliable or efficient or trustworthy. It's working for me for the things I need. You'll be probably better served by using arcpy (I don't know).  
Layer status (ON/OFF) can return ambiguous results. Pressing 'save' icon twice before closing project fixed this for me.
